# TWITCHER
This the MTE project for SE and COA
Seeing the blooming Esports industry, Twitcher  is a new step for social media which is all about the gamers. Twitcher is going to be a website where competitive gamers from all around the world can communicate like twitter but it's game specific like twitch, hence this project involves designing and developing a social platform for gamers and the gaming community. 
I believe this app will be interactive and user friendly. My main motive while making this will be how i can make this platform different and entertaining at the same time. 




This project has allowed us to experiment and work with some very interesting concepts in Software engineering & computer organization and architecture and implement them in real-world scenarios.  The idea might not be completely new or truly innovative, but it allowed me to explore some existing concepts and enhance them through innovation.
This particular app, or specifically modified versions of it(with enhanced features and UI), 
On the other hand, the project also allowed me to learn about working on COA with the android OS also using the theoretical knowledge from Software engineering ive been able to build an App which in itself is a great achievement.
 
It is also to be noted that this project is being built with main purposes being learning and  demonstrating the relation between apps and the COA and SE.
So at this very stage of submission, the app might not be launch ready as launching the app to the world requires considering a lot of factors including the user interface, user experience, and a lot more functionalities. Implementing all those functionalities might not be possible given the time frame for the project and the level of our current skills.
 However, as mentioned above, this project has brought us great opportunities in learning and innovating. With that being said, this project could be a great starting point and hopefully enough to be within the scope of the MTE innovative project for COA SE 204  and Software Engineering 202.
